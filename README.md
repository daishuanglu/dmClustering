# Deep Metric Similarity Clustering
Authors: Shuanglu Dai, Pengyu Su and Hong Man

This repository implements deep metric similarity clustering (DMSC), a clustering algorithm incorporates deep network representation. We showed a self-supervised learning of deep metrics can boost the clustering performs on both images and data vectors.

## Dependencies

- pytorch
- sklearn
- numpy, scipy

Note: as no advanced package dependency and installation is required, this code is left as it is. 

## How to run

```bash
# To reproduce the major results in our published work
python dmClusteringEval.py
```

## Please kindly refer to our published work if used for research purpose
